crisis id="RwandaGen": 
named: Rwanda Genocide
type: Murder
date: 1994-04-06
city: 
country: Rwanda

description: There had always been heavy ethnic tension between the majority Hutu people and the Tutsis 
in Rwanda since the country's establishment. The Hutu both resented and feared the Tutsi minority for the 
decades of oppression they had to withstand. They finally overthew the Tutsi monarchy in a rebellion in 
1959-1962 and established their own Hutu lead government. In the years following, social, economic, and 
political pressures grew and the Hutu political elite blamed the entire Tutsi minority for these problems. 
Soon after, a Tutsi-dominated rebel group, the Rwandan Patriotic Front, made a push to overthrow the Hutu 
led government; this led to a civil war and heavier resentment of the Tutsi people. The civil war ended in 
1994 where President Juvenal Habyarimana signed a cease-fire with the Tutsi rebel group.
In April 1994, shortly after President Habyarimana's plane was shot down violence errupted overnight in 
cities and towns around the country. The Hutu extremist political party had organized two primary militia 
groups to carry out the genocide of the Tutsis in advance in order to maintain their political power/influence. 
These two groups carried out mass murders on Tutsi men, women, and children, as well as Hutu people who were 
against the murders. Though the two militia groups were responsible for initiating many of the attacks on the 
Tutsi people, the actual murders were carried out by Hutu civilians; they were given the order by militia groups 
to either kill their Tutsi friends/neighbors or be killed themselves. Many Hutu civilians had no trouble killing 
them since there was much resent towards them over the past years. This genocide continued for three months until 
the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF), a rebel group composed of mostly Tutsi refugees, defeated the Hutu perpetrator 
regime and its supporters.

crisis id="ChileanEarth": 
named: 2010 Chilean Earthquake
type: Natural Disaster
date: 2010-02-27
city: 
country: Chile

description: Chile's Pacific coast lies on the "Ring of Fire", the line frequent earthquakes and volcanic 
eruptions that circles the Pacific rim.  There has been 123 documented notable earthquakes with its epicenter 
within Chile since 1570.  The largest magintude earthquake occurred May 22, 1960 with a magnitude of 9.5, 
which is to date the most powerful earthquake ever recorded on earth.  The most recent earthquake occurred 
March 25, 2012 with a magnitude of 7.1.  This history of frequent earthquakes has made Chile one of the most 
well-prepared nations against earthquakes.  Chile has strict building codes, robust emergency response, and an 
educated population. Homes and buildings in Chile are built to ride out earthquakes, their steel skeletons 
designed to sway with seismic waves.  Also Chile has the most world-renowned seismologists and earthquake 
engineers per capita. These professionals are heeded by the government to advise in government contingency 
planning.  Finally, the people in Chile have most likely experienced an earthquake before and know how to 
react when one occurs (by sheltering under tables and door frames).
An earthquake of 8.8 magnitude occured off the coast of central Chile, lasting for about three minutes.  
The earthquake ranks as the sixth largest earthquake recorded and was felt throughout most of Chile and 
many other South American countries.  It also triggered a tsunami which devastated the south-central 
Chilean coast and damaged areas in California and Japan. The earthquake generated a blackout that affected 
93% of the country, lasting several days.  Chile was declared to be in a "state of catastrophe" by President 
Michelle Bachelet, who deployed military troops to take control of the most affected areas.  525 people lost 
their lives and 9% of the population lost their homes.  The total loss to Chilean economy is estimated to be at 
US$15-30 billion.

..................................... Avian Flu .....................................

crisis id="AvianFlu": 
named: Avian Flu
type: Pandemic 
date: 1997-01-01 
city: 
country: Worldwide

description: 1997 was the first year that cases of human-infecting H5N1 arose. 18 Humans 
were infected and 6 died in Hong Kong. H5N1 re-emerged in January 2003 in mainland China, 
killing 2 out of the 3 people infected. In 2004, 32 of 46 people infected died in Thailand 
and Vietnam. In 2005, 43 of 82 people infected died in 5 Asian countries. In 2006, 79 of 115 
people infected died in 9 countries including the Middle East and African areas. In 2007, 
59 of 88 people infected died in 9 countries. In 2008, 33 of 44 people died in 6 countries. 
In 2009, 32 of 73 people infected died in 5 countries. In 2010, 24 of 48 people infected died 
in 5 countries. In 2011,  34 of 62 infected died in 5 countries. So far in 2012, 17 of 28 
infected people died in 6 countries. Officials believe that there are many more unreported 
cases of H5N1 infections.
Avian influenza refers to "influenza caused by viruses adapted to birds." A subtype of avian 
infleunza named H5N1 is able to adapt to humans causing an influenza pandemic. This strain of 
influenza is spreading globally after first appearing in Asia. On October 10, 2011 the WHO 
announced a total of 566 confirmed human cases which resulted in the deaths of 332 people 
since 2003. Tens of millions of birds have died of H5N1 influenza and hundreds of millions 
of birds have been slaughtered and disposed of, to limit the spread of H5N1. Studies have 
indicated that these strains of influenza continue to evolve and mutate, expanding its host 
resoirvoir. Human-to-human transmission has not been found, however a mutation that allows 
this will surely bring a deadly pandemic.

..................................... Global Climate Change .....................................

crisis id="GlobalC": 
named: Global Climate Change
type: Environmental

!-- Need to mod date, string for post industrial rev. possibility --: 
date: 1750-01-01
location: 
city: 
country: World-wide

description: 
It is estimated that, for the past 600,000 years or so, our planet has gone through many cycles of 
moderate climate change; each cycle has been roughly the same repeat of the previous one before it 
and the conditions (concentrations of carbon dioxide, sea levels, etc.) that caused these changes have 
also been around the same. In the recent decades though, the conditions that once evoked these 
moderate changes in the climate have all changed drastically. These once moderate concentrations have 
increased exponentially more than ever before and are now causing the climates in several parts of the 
planet to change completely from what they once were. Starting with the industrial revolution and on 
the concentration of green house gases in the atmosphere have skyrocketed.
Over the past several decades, the global climate has been changing at a much faster rate than it 
normally did in the past and it is affecting areas around the world in several different ways. 
There is physical evidence in many parts of the world to support this argument, glaciers that once 
ran for miles just a few decades ago are barely visible today, sea levels have risen at much more 
dramatic rates than is normally expected, and patterns of precipitation have changed throughout the 
world as well. These events and many more are largely due to how careless humans have been when it 
comes to evironmental and climate concerns. The amount of green house gases that surrounds the planet 
and keeps a respected temperature for each part of the globe have increased at an exponential rate. 
These are largely a result of human activities in the past decades.
