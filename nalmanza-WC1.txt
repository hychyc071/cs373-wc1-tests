id: 			invisible
Name: 			Invisible Children
Kind: 			Non-profit organization
Location: 		United States, Uganda
History: 		Invisible Children, Inc. is a non-profit organization founded in 2004 to bring awareness to the activities of the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) in Central Africa, and its leader, 				Joseph Kony. Specifically, the group seeks to put an end to the practices of the LRA which include abductions and abuse of children, and forcing them to serve as soldiers. To this 				end, Invisible Children urges the United States government to take military action in the central region of Africa. Invisible Children also operates as a charitable organization, 				soliciting donations and selling merchandise to raise money for their cause. The organization promotes its cause by dispensing films on the internet and presenting in high schools 				and colleges around the United States.

id: 			pan
Name: 			National Action Party
Kind: 			Political Party (Mexico)
Location: 		Mexico
History: 		Founded in 1939 by Manuel Gómez Morán, the National Action Party (Partido de Acción Nacional--PAN) was the first genuine opposition party to develop in Mexico. The PAN emerged as a 				conservative reaction against the nationalizations and land confiscations undertaken by the Cárdenas government during the 1930s. The PAN resembled a standard Christian Democratic 				party, and its early support derived primarily from the Roman Catholic Church, the business sector, and other groups alienated by the left-wing populist reforms of the Cárdenas 				government. Although the PAN is much more conservative than the PRI on social issues, since the mid-1980s the PAN's economic program has been almost indistinguishable from that of 				the PRI governments it has attempted to supplant.

id: 			republican
Name: 			Republican Party
Kind: 			Political Party (USA)
Location: 		United States
History: 		The Republican Party is one of the two major contemporary political parties in the United States, along with the Democratic Party. Founded by anti-slavery expansion activists in 				1854, it is often called the GOP (Grand Old Party), although the rival Democratic Party is older. Eighteen US presidents have been Republicans.
			The party's platform generally reflects American conservatism in the U.S. political spectrum. American conservatism of the Republican Party is not wholly based upon rejection of the 				political ideology of liberalism, as many principles of American conservatism are based upon classical liberalism. Rather the Republican Party's conservatism is largely based upon 				its support of classical liberal principles against the modern liberalism of the Democratic Party that is considered American liberalism in contemporary American political discourse.
