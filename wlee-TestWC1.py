The protests were given several titles by their proponents including Green Revolution, Green Wave or Sea of Green, reflecting presidential candidate Mousavi\'s campaign color, and also Persian Awakening. The creation of the Iranian Green Movement was developed during these protests. The events have also been nicknamed the \"Twitter Revolution\" because of the protesters\' reliance on Twitter and other social-networking Internet sites to communicate with each other. Islamic politician Ata\'ollah Mohajerani blasted the election as \"the end of the Islamic Republic\". In response to the protests, other groups rallied in Tehran to support Ahmadinejad. Widespread editorial analyses assert that the 2009 election marks the official end of the Islamic Republic and the beginning of the Islamic emirate or an imamate regime. All three opposition candidates claimed that the votes were manipulated and the election was rigged, and candidates Mohsen Rezaee and Mousavi have lodged official complaints. Mousavi announced that he \"won\'t surrender to this manipulation\" before lodging an official appeal against the result to the Guardian Council on 14 June. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei declared the unprecedented voter turnout and coinciding religious holidays as a \"divine assessment\" and urged the nation to unite, but later ostensibly ordered an investigation into the claims of voting fraud and irregularities as per the request of the Green movement leaders. Mousavi is not optimistic about his appeal, saying that many of the group\'s members \"during the election were not impartial\". Ahmadinejad called the election \"completely free\" and the outcome \"a great victory\" for Iran, dismissing the protests as little more than \"passions after a soccer match\". Police and the Basij (a paramilitary group) suppressed both peaceful demonstrating and rioting by using batons, pepper spray, sticks and, in some cases, firearms. The Iranian government has confirmed the deaths of 36 people during the protests, while unconfirmed reports by supporters of Mousavi allege that there have been 72 deaths (twice as many) in the three months following the disputed election. Iranian authorities have closed universities in Tehran, blocked web sites, blocked cell phone transmissions and text messaging, and banned rallies.")

Kadeer has also served as vice chairwoman of the Xinjiang Autonomous Region Federation of Industry and Commerce, and vice chairwoman of the Xinjiang Association of Women Entrepreneurs.

The government arrested a large number of the protesters and several were killed by the police and governmental militia forces. Handala, coming and watching the Iranian Green Movement, has become a web mascot. Although the Iranian government prohibited any form of gathering by opposition-supporters in Tehran and across the country, significantly slowed down internet access and censored any form of media agreeing with the opposition, hundreds of thousands of Iranians chanted this motto, defying the law and challenging the Islamic Republic.</human_impact>\n\t\t\t<resources_needed>World Support</resources_needed>\n\t\t\t<ways_to_help>Oppose a Military Strike on Iran, Call for the Release of Opposition Leaders Under House Arrest, Call for the release of imprisoned human rights lawyer Nasrin Sotoudeh!</ways_to_help>\n\t\t\t<history>Protests following the 2009 Iranian presidential election against the disputed victory of Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and in support of opposition candidates Mir-Hossein Mousavi and Mehdi Karroubi occurred in major cities in Iran and around the world starting 13 June 2009. The protests were given several titles by their proponents including Green Revolution, Green Wave or Sea of Green, reflecting presidential candidate Mousavi\'s campaign color, and also Persian Awakening. The creation of the Iranian Green Movement was developed during these protests. The events have also been nicknamed the \"Twitter Revolution\" because of the protesters\' reliance on Twitter and other social-networking Internet sites to communicate with each other. Islamic politician Ata\'ollah Mohajerani blasted the election as \"the end of the Islamic Republic\". In response to the protests, other groups rallied in Tehran to support Ahmadinejad. Widespread editorial analyses assert that the 2009 election marks the official end of the Islamic Republic and the beginning of the Islamic emirate or an imamate regime. All three opposition candidates claimed that the votes were manipulated and the election was rigged, and candidates Mohsen Rezaee and Mousavi have lodged official complaints. Mousavi announced that he \"won\'t surrender to this manipulation\" before lodging an official appeal against the result to the Guardian Council on 14 June. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei declared the unprecedented voter turnout and coinciding religious holidays as a \"divine assessment\" and urged the nation to unite, but later ostensibly ordered an investigation into the claims of voting fraud and irregularities as per the request of the Green movement leaders. Mousavi is not optimistic about his appeal, saying that many of the group\'s members \"during the election were not impartial\". Ahmadinejad called the election \"completely free\" and the outcome \"a great victory\" for Iran, dismissing the protests as little more than \"passions after a soccer match\". Police and the Basij (a paramilitary group) suppressed both peaceful demonstrating and rioting by using batons, pepper spray, sticks and, in some cases, firearms. The Iranian government has confirmed the deaths of 36 people during the protests, while unconfirmed reports by supporters of Mousavi allege that there have been 72 deaths (twice as many) in the three months following the disputed election. Iranian authorities have closed universities in Tehran, blocked web sites, blocked cell phone transmissions and text messaging, and banned rallies.</history>\n\t\t\t<images>\n\t\t\t\t<link>http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/66/6th_Day_-_Mousavi_inside_the_Crowd.jpg/800px-6th_Day_-_Mousavi_inside_the_Crowd.jpg</link>\n\t\t\t</images>\n\t\t\t<videos>\n\t\t\t\t<link>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quPXg_GoTOk&amp;feature=related</link>\n\t\t\t</videos>\n\t\t\t<social_networks>\n\t\t\t\t<link>http://www.facebook.com/Persian.Green.Movement</link>\n\t\t\t</social_networks>\n\t\t\t<external_links>\n\t\t\t\t<link>http://en.irangreenvoice.com</link>\n\t\t\t</external_links>\n\t\t\t<related_orgs>\n\t\t\t\t<orgRef>International_Campaign_for_Human_Rights_in_Iran</orgRef>\n\t\t\t</related_orgs>\n\t\t\t<related_people>\n\t\t\t\t<personRef>Mir_Hossein_Mousavi</personRef>\n\t\t\t</related_people>\n\t\t</crisis>\n\t\t<crisis>\n\t\t\t<name>Xinjiang Riots</name>\n\t\t\t<kind>anti-government/ethnic protest</kind>\n\t\t\t<location>Urumqi, Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, China</location>\n\t\t\t<date_and_time>5 July 2009</date_and_time>\n\t\t\t<human_impact>197 deaths, 1721 injured</human_impact>\n\t\t\t<economic_impact>Uyghur businesses destroyed by Chinese mob</economic_impact>\n\t\t\t<history>The July 2009 Xinjiang riots were a series of violent riots over several days that broke out on 5 July 2009 in Urumqi, the capital city of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR), in northwestern People\'s Republic of China (PRC). The first day\'s rioting, which involved at least 1,000 Uyghurs, began as a protest but escalated into violent attacks that mainly targeted Han (\"ethnic Chinese\") people. People\'s Armed Police were deployed, and two days later hundreds of Han people clashed with both police and Uyghurs. PRC officials said that a total of 197 people died, with 1,721 others injured and many vehicles and buildings destroyed; on the other hand, Uyghur exile groups say the death toll is higher. Many men disappeared during wide-scale police sweeps in the days following the riots; Human Rights Watch (HRW) documented 43 cases and said figures for real disappearances were likely to be much higher. </history>\n\t\t\t<images>\n\t\t\t\t<link>http://www.farwestchina.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Urumqi-Riots.jpg</link>\n\t\t\t\t<link>http://english.people.com.cn/mediafile/200907/07/P200907072014041872629287.jpg</link>\n\t\t\t\t<link>http://english.people.com.cn/mediafile/200907/07/P200907072014352294282832.jpg</link>\n\t\t\t\t<link>http://english.people.com.cn/mediafile/200907/07/P200907072018061766028774.jpg</link>\n\t\t\t\t<link>http://english.people.com.cn/mediafile/200907/07/P200907072017392257014210.jpg</link>\n\t\t\t\t<link>http://english.people.com.cn/mediafile/200907/07/P200907072017145684313201.jpg</link>\n\t\t\t\t<link>http://english.people.com.cn/mediafile/200907/07/P200907072016482444221649.jpg</link>\n\t\t\t\t<link>http://english.people.com.cn/mediafile/200907/07/P200907072016212332964133.jpg</link>\n\t\t\t\t<link>http://english.people.com.cn/mediafile/200907/07/P200907072015483259527910.jpg</link>\n\t\t\t\t<link>http://english.people.com.cn/mediafile/200907/07/P200907072015165972213332.jpg</link>\n\t\t\t\t<link>http://english.people.com.cn/mediafile/200907/07/P200907072014551663971071.jpg</link>\n\t\t\t</images>\n\t\t\t<videos>\n\t\t\t\t<link>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DN3gUoWTnkY</link>\n\t\t\t\t<link>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AzlgXQaJ3I</link>\n\t\t\t\t<link>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3jkr7fsdsc</link>\n\t\t\t\t<link>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwCHfBfF1m4</link>\n\t\t\t</videos>\n\t\t\t<social_networks>\n\t\t\t\t<link>https://twitter.com/#!/UYGHURS</link>\n\t\t\t</social_networks>\n\t\t\t<external_links>\n\t\t\t\t<link>http://english.cntv.cn/english/special/0705riots/UrumqiRiots/index.shtml</link>\n\t\t\t\t<link>http://cnreviews.com/life/news-issues/urumqi-riots-western-chinese-narratives-truths_20090708.html</link>\n\t\t\t\t<link>http://forum.globaltimes.cn/forum/showthread.php?t=912</link>\n\t\t\t\t<link>http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/china/5756766/China-riots-Twitter-and-YouTube-frustrate-censorship-attempts.html</link>\n\t\t\t</external_links>\n\t\t\t<related_orgs>\n\t\t\t\t<orgRef>World_Uyghur_Congress</orgRef>\n\t\t\t</related_orgs>\n\t\t\t<related_people>\n\t\t\t\t<personRef>Rebiya_Kadeer</personRef>\n\t\t\t</related_people>\n\t\t</crisis>\n\t</crises>\n\t<orgs>\n\t\t<org>\n\t\t\t<name>World Uyghur Congress</name>\n\t\t\t<kind>international org. of exiled Uyghurs</kind>\n\t\t\t<location>80103 Munich, Germany</location>\n\t\t\t<history>The World Uyghur Congress (WUC) is an international organisation that represents the collective interest of the Uyghur people both in East Turkestan and abroad.

The ICC is an independent international organisation, and is not part of the United Nations system. Its seat is at The Hague in the Netherlands. Although the Court\'s expenses are funded primarily by States Parties, it also receives voluntary contributions from governments, international organisations, individuals, corporations and other entities. The international community has long aspired to the creation of a permanent international court, and, in the 20th century, it reached consensus on definitions of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. The Nuremberg and Tokyo trials addressed war crimes, crimes against peace, and crimes against humanity committed during the Second World War.\nIn the 1990s after the end of the Cold War, tribunals like the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia and for Rwanda were the result of consensus that impunity is unacceptable. However, because they were established to try crimes committed only within a specific time-frame and during a specific conflict, there was general agreement that an independent, permanent criminal court was needed.\nOn 17 July 1998, the international community reached an historic milestone when 120 States adopted the Rome Statute, the legal basis for establishing the permanent International Criminal Court. The Rome Statute entered into force on 1 July 2002 after ratification by 60 countries. </history>\n\t\t\t<contact_info>\n\t\t\t\t<email>visits@icc-cpi.int</email>\n\t\t\t\t<phone_number>+ 31 (0)70 515 8515</phone_number>\n\t\t\t\t<address>Po Box 19519\n2500 CM, The Hague\nThe Netherlands</address>\n\t\t\t</contact_info>\n\t\t\t<images>\n\t\t\t\t<link>http://archive2.globalsolutions.org/files/general/icc.jpg</link>\n\t\t\t\t<link>http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ae/International_Criminal_Court_logo.svg/673px-International_Criminal_Court_logo.svg.png</link>\n\t\t\t</images>\n\t\t\t<videos>\n\t\t\t\t<link>http://youtu.be/zfo7lMnR4O8</link>\n\t\t\t</videos>\n\t\t\t<social_networks>\n\t\t\t\t<link>http://www.facebook.com/pages/International-Criminal-Court/106219979409522</link>\n\t\t\t\t<link>http://twitter.com/#!/IntlCrimCourt</link>\n\t\t\t</social_networks>\n\t\t\t<external_links>\n\t\t\t\t<link>http://www.icc-cpi.int</link>\n\t\t\t</external_links>\n\t\t\t<related_crises>\n\t\t\t\t<crisisRef>Libyan_Civil_War</crisisRef>\n\t\t\t</related_crises>\n\t\t</org>\n\t\t<org>\n\t\t\t<name>Amnesty International</name>\n\t\t\t<kind>non-governmental organisation focused on human rights</kind>\n\t\t\t<location>Global, General secretariat in London</location>\n\t\t\t<history>Amnesty International (commonly known as Amnesty and AI) is a non-governmental organization focused on human rights with over 3 million members and supporters around the world.

Amnesty draws attention to human rights abuses and campaigns for compliance with international laws and standards. It works to mobilize public opinion to put pressure on governments that let abuse take place.

During the civil war, Abdul Jalil was identified as the Chairman of the National Transitional Council based in Benghazi, although this position was contested by others in the uprising due to his past direct participation in Gaddafi\'s government as Minister of Justice for four years until 2011. </history>\n\t\t\t<images>\n\t\t\t\t<link>http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-tHBHlck16yA/TqK7Lqeh2TI/AAAAAAAACd0/7OSD4-lQukw/s1600/head+bump.jpg</link>\n\t\t\t\t<link>http://a.abcnews.go.com/images/International/42daef1774e44bd78ea83fd9878c269d.jpg</link>\n\t\t\t</images>\n\t\t\t<videos>\n\t\t\t\t<link>http://youtu.be/eNLc_OuPVxQ</link>\n\t\t\t</videos>\n\t\t\t<social_networks>\n\t\t\t\t<link>http://www.facebook.com/pages/%D9%85%D8%B5%D8%B7%D9%81%D9%89-%D8%B9%D8%A8%D8%AF-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AC%D9%84%D9%8A%D9%84/134535143287038?rf=135221043216666</link>\n\t\t\t\t<link>http://twitter.com/#!/mustafaajalil</link>\n\t\t\t</social_networks>\n\t\t\t<external_links>\n\t\t\t\t<link>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-14613679</link>\n\t\t\t</external_links>\n\t\t\t<related_crises>\n\t\t\t\t<crisisRef>Libyan_Civil_War</crisisRef>\n\t\t\t</related_crises>\n\t\t</person>\n\t\t<person>\n\t\t\t<name>Mir Hossein Mousavi</name>\n\t\t\t<kind>Presidential Candidate of 2009 Iran\'s Elections</kind>\n\t\t\t<location>Tehran, Iran</location>\n\t\t\t<history>In 2009 Iranian Presidential election, Mousavi came out of semi-retirement and ran as one of two Reformist candidates against the Administration of incumbent President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. However he failed to win the election, and following alleged vote rigging and manipulation, his campaign sparked a long protest that eventually turned into a national movement against the Government and Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei. Despite the violent crackdown, he remains the leader of the Green Movement but his movements have remained severely restricted. He chose green as his campaign color, a color which has since become pervasive in Iran.

The protests were given several titles by their proponents including Green Revolution, Green Wave or Sea of Green, reflecting presidential candidate Mousavi\'s campaign color, and also Persian Awakening. The creation of the Iranian Green Movement was developed during these protests. The events have also been nicknamed the \"Twitter Revolution\" because of the protesters\' reliance on Twitter and other social-networking Internet sites to communicate with each other. Islamic politician Ata\'ollah Mohajerani blasted the election as \"the end of the Islamic Republic\". In response to the protests, other groups rallied in Tehran to support Ahmadinejad. Widespread editorial analyses assert that the 2009 election marks the official end of the Islamic Republic and the beginning of the Islamic emirate or an imamate regime. All three opposition candidates claimed that the votes were manipulated and the election was rigged, and candidates Mohsen Rezaee and Mousavi have lodged official complaints. Mousavi announced that he \"won\'t surrender to this manipulation\" before lodging an official appeal against the result to the Guardian Council on 14 June. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei declared the unprecedented voter turnout and coinciding religious holidays as a \"divine assessment\" and urged the nation to unite, but later ostensibly ordered an investigation into the claims of voting fraud and irregularities as per the request of the Green movement leaders. Mousavi is not optimistic about his appeal, saying that many of the group\'s members \"during the election were not impartial\". Ahmadinejad called the election \"completely free\" and the outcome \"a great victory\" for Iran, dismissing the protests as little more than \"passions after a soccer match\". Police and the Basij (a paramilitary group) suppressed both peaceful demonstrating and rioting by using batons, pepper spray, sticks and, in some cases, firearms. The Iranian government has confirmed the deaths of 36 people during the protests, while unconfirmed reports by supporters of Mousavi allege that there have been 72 deaths (twice as many) in the three months following the disputed election. Iranian authorities have closed universities in Tehran, blocked web sites, blocked cell phone transmissions and text messaging, and banned rallies.</history>\n\t\t\t<images>\n\t\t\t\t<link>http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/66/6th_Day_-_Mousavi_inside_the_Crowd.jpg/800px-6th_Day_-_Mousavi_inside_the_Crowd.jpg</link>\n\t\t\t</images>\n\t\t\t<videos>\n\t\t\t\t<link>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quPXg_GoTOk&amp;feature=related</link>\n\t\t\t</videos>\n\t\t\t<social_networks>\n\t\t\t\t<link>http://www.facebook.com/Persian.Green.Movement</link>\n\t\t\t</social_networks>\n\t\t\t<external_links>\n\t\t\t\t<link>http://en.irangreenvoice.com</link>\n\t\t\t</external_links>\n\t\t\t<related_orgs>\n\t\t\t\t<orgRef>International_Campaign_for_Human_Rights_in_Iran</orgRef>\n\t\t\t</related_orgs>\n\t\t\t<related_people>\n\t\t\t\t<personRef>Mir_Hossein_Mousavi</personRef>\n\t\t\t</related_people>\n\t\t</crisis>\n\t\t<crisis>\n\t\t\t<name>Xinjiang Riots</name>\n\t\t\t<kind>anti-government/ethnic protest</kind>\n\t\t\t<location>Urumqi, Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, China</location>\n\t\t\t<date_and_time>5 July 2009</date_and_time>\n\t\t\t<human_impact>197 deaths, 1721 injured</human_impact>\n\t\t\t<economic_impact>Uyghur businesses destroyed by Chinese mob</economic_impact>\n\t\t\t<history>The July 2009 Xinjiang riots were a series of violent riots over several days that broke out on 5 July 2009 in Urumqi, the capital city of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR), in northwestern People\'s Republic of China (PRC). The first day\'s rioting, which involved at least 1,000 Uyghurs, began as a protest but escalated into violent attacks that mainly targeted Han (\"ethnic Chinese\") people. People\'s Armed Police were deployed, and two days later hundreds of Han people clashed with both police and Uyghurs. PRC officials said that a total of 197 people died, with 1,721 others injured and many vehicles and buildings destroyed; on the other hand, Uyghur exile groups say the death toll is higher. Many men disappeared during wide-scale police sweeps in the days following the riots; Human Rights Watch (HRW) documented 43 cases and said figures for real disappearances were likely to be much higher. </history>\n\t\t\t<images>\n\t\t\t\t<link>http://www.farwestchina.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Urumqi-Riots.jpg</link>\n\t\t\t\t<link>http://english.people.com.cn/mediafile/200907/07/P200907072014041872629287.jpg</link>\n\t\t\t\t<link>http://english.people.com.cn/mediafile/200907/07/P200907072014352294282832.jpg</link>\n\t\t\t\t<link>http://english.people.com.cn/mediafile/200907/07/P200907072018061766028774.jpg</link>\n\t\t\t\t<link>http://english.people.com.cn/mediafile/200907/07/P200907072017392257014210.jpg</link>\n\t\t\t\t<link>http://english.people.com.cn/mediafile/200907/07/P200907072017145684313201.jpg</link>\n\t\t\t\t<link>http://english.people.com.cn/mediafile/200907/07/P200907072016482444221649.jpg</link>\n\t\t\t\t<link>http://english.people.com.cn/mediafile/200907/07/P200907072016212332964133.jpg</link>\n\t\t\t\t<link>http://english.people.com.cn/mediafile/200907/07/P200907072015483259527910.jpg</link>\n\t\t\t\t<link>http://english.people.com.cn/mediafile/200907/07/P200907072015165972213332.jpg</link>\n\t\t\t\t<link>http://english.people.com.cn/mediafile/200907/07/P200907072014551663971071.jpg</link>\n\t\t\t</images>\n\t\t\t<videos>\n\t\t\t\t<link>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DN3gUoWTnkY</link>\n\t\t\t\t<link>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AzlgXQaJ3I</link>\n\t\t\t\t<link>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3jkr7fsdsc</link>\n\t\t\t\t<link>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwCHfBfF1m4</link>\n\t\t\t</videos>\n\t\t\t<social_networks>\n\t\t\t\t<link>https://twitter.com/#!/UYGHURS</link>\n\t\t\t</social_networks>\n\t\t\t<external_links>\n\t\t\t\t<link>http://english.cntv.cn/english/special/0705riots/UrumqiRiots/index.shtml</link>\n\t\t\t\t<link>http://cnreviews.com/life/news-issues/urumqi-riots-western-chinese-narratives-truths_20090708.html</link>\n\t\t\t\t<link>http://forum.globaltimes.cn/forum/showthread.php?t=912</link>\n\t\t\t\t<link>http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/china/5756766/China-riots-Twitter-and-YouTube-frustrate-censorship-attempts.html</link>\n\t\t\t</external_links>\n\t\t\t<related_orgs>\n\t\t\t\t<orgRef>World_Uyghur_Congress</orgRef>\n\t\t\t</related_orgs>\n\t\t\t<related_people>\n\t\t\t\t<personRef>Rebiya_Kadeer</personRef>\n\t\t\t</related_people>\n\t\t</crisis>\n\t</crises>\n\t<orgs>\n\t\t<org>\n\t\t\t<name>World Uyghur Congress</name>\n\t\t\t<kind>international org. of exiled Uyghurs</kind>\n\t\t\t<location>80103 Munich, Germany</location>\n\t\t\t<history>The World Uyghur Congress (WUC) is an international organisation that represents the collective interest of the Uyghur people both in East Turkestan and abroad.

The ICC is an independent international organisation, and is not part of the United Nations system. Its seat is at The Hague in the Netherlands. Although the Court\'s expenses are funded primarily by States Parties, it also receives voluntary contributions from governments, international organisations, individuals, corporations and other entities. The international community has long aspired to the creation of a permanent international court, and, in the 20th century, it reached consensus on definitions of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. The Nuremberg and Tokyo trials addressed war crimes, crimes against peace, and crimes against humanity committed during the Second World War.\nIn the 1990s after the end of the Cold War, tribunals like the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia and for Rwanda were the result of consensus that impunity is unacceptable. However, because they were established to try crimes committed only within a specific time-frame and during a specific conflict, there was general agreement that an independent, permanent criminal court was needed.\nOn 17 July 1998, the international community reached an historic milestone when 120 States adopted the Rome Statute, the legal basis for establishing the permanent International Criminal Court. The Rome Statute entered into force on 1 July 2002 after ratification by 60 countries. </history>\n\t\t\t<contact_info>\n\t\t\t\t<email>visits@icc-cpi.int</email>\n\t\t\t\t<phone_number>+ 31 (0)70 515 8515</phone_number>\n\t\t\t\t<address>Po Box 19519\n2500 CM, The Hague\nThe Netherlands</address>\n\t\t\t</contact_info>\n\t\t\t<images>\n\t\t\t\t<link>http://archive2.globalsolutions.org/files/general/icc.jpg</link>\n\t\t\t\t<link>http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ae/International_Criminal_Court_logo.svg/673px-International_Criminal_Court_logo.svg.png</link>\n\t\t\t</images>\n\t\t\t<videos>\n\t\t\t\t<link>http://youtu.be/zfo7lMnR4O8</link>\n\t\t\t</videos>\n\t\t\t<social_networks>\n\t\t\t\t<link>http://www.facebook.com/pages/International-Criminal-Court/106219979409522</link>\n\t\t\t\t<link>http://twitter.com/#!/IntlCrimCourt</link>\n\t\t\t</social_networks>\n\t\t\t<external_links>\n\t\t\t\t<link>http://www.icc-cpi.int</link>\n\t\t\t</external_links>\n\t\t\t<related_crises>\n\t\t\t\t<crisisRef>Libyan_Civil_War</crisisRef>\n\t\t\t</related_crises>\n\t\t</org>\n\t\t<org>\n\t\t\t<name>Amnesty International</name>\n\t\t\t<kind>non-governmental organisation focused on human rights</kind>\n\t\t\t<location>Global, General secretariat in London</location>\n\t\t\t<history>Amnesty International (commonly known as Amnesty and AI) is a non-governmental organization focused on human rights with over 3 million members and supporters around the world. The objective of the organization is \"to conduct research and generate action to prevent and end grave abuses of human rights, and to demand justice for those whose rights have been violated.\" Amnesty International was founded in London in 1961, following the publication of the article \"The Forgotten Prisoners\" in The Observer 28 May 1961, by the lawyer Peter Benenson. Amnesty draws attention to human rights abuses and campaigns for compliance with international laws and standards. It works to mobilize public opinion to put pressure on governments that let abuse take place. The organization was awarded the 1977 Nobel Peace Prize for its \"campaign against torture\", and the United Nations Prize in the Field of Human Rights in 1978</history>\n\t\t\t<contact_info>\n\t\t\t\t<email>Various department emails available at www.amnesty.org.</email>\n\t\t\t\t<phone_number>+44-20-74135500</phone_number>\n\t\t\t\t<address>1 Easton Street\nLondon\nWC1X 0DW, UK</address>\n\t\t\t</contact_info>\n\t\t\t<images>\n\t\t\t\t<link>http://www.codoc.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/amnesty.jpeg</link>\n\t\t\t</images>\n\t\t\t<videos>\n\t\t\t\t<link>http://www.youtube.com/user/AmnestyInternational</link>\n\t\t\t</videos>\n\t\t\t<social_networks>\n\t\t\t\t<link>http://twitter.com/#!/amnesty</link>\n\t\t\t</social_networks>\n\t\t\t<external_links>\n\t\t\t\t<link>http://www.amnesty.org</link>\n\t\t\t\t<link>http://www.amnesty.org/en/news/iran-must-avoid-excessive-force-against-green-movement-protests-2012-02-13</link>\n\t\t\t</external_links>\n\t\t\t<related_crises>\n\t\t\t\t<crisisRef>Syrian_Uprising</crisisRef>\n\t\t\t\t<crisisRef>Xinjiang_Riots</crisisRef>\n\t\t\t\t<crisisRef>Libyan_Civil_War</crisisRef>\n\t\t\t</related_crises>\n\t\t\t<related_people>\n\t\t\t\t<personRef>Rebiya_Kadeer</personRef>\n\t\t\t\t<personRef>Mustafa_Abdul_Jalil</personRef>\n\t\t\t\t<personRef>Bashar_al-Assad</personRef>\n\t\t\t\t<personRef>Mir_Hossein_Mousavi</personRef>\n\t\t\t</related_people>\n\t\t</org>\n\t\t<org>\n\t\t\t<name>International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran</name>\n\t\t\t<kind>Campaign</kind>\n\t\t\t<location>Netherlands</location>\n\t\t\t<history>In late 2007, human rights activists working in the framework of the Dutch nongovernmental organization Foundation for Human Security in the Middle East resolved to found an international initiative focused on the urgent challenges faced by the Iranian people, and in particular civil society and the human rights community.The human rights community in Iran is in an exposed and dangerous position, subject to severe persecution and without effective support from the international community.

The vibrant social movements in Iran movements, inter alia, of women, students, and workers work courageously in an un-free environment, subject to tremendous official pressures.

During the civil war, Abdul Jalil was identified as the Chairman of the National Transitional Council based in Benghazi, although this position was contested by others in the uprising due to his past direct participation in Gaddafi\'s government as Minister of Justice for four years until 2011. </history>\n\t\t\t<images>\n\t\t\t\t<link>http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-tHBHlck16yA/TqK7Lqeh2TI/AAAAAAAACd0/7OSD4-lQukw/s1600/head+bump.jpg</link>\n\t\t\t\t<link>http://a.abcnews.go.com/images/International/42daef1774e44bd78ea83fd9878c269d.jpg</link>\n\t\t\t</images>\n\t\t\t<videos>\n\t\t\t\t<link>http://youtu.be/eNLc_OuPVxQ</link>\n\t\t\t</videos>\n\t\t\t<social_networks>\n\t\t\t\t<link>http://www.facebook.com/pages/%D9%85%D8%B5%D8%B7%D9%81%D9%89-%D8%B9%D8%A8%D8%AF-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AC%D9%84%D9%8A%D9%84/134535143287038?rf=135221043216666</link>\n\t\t\t\t<link>http://twitter.com/#!/mustafaajalil</link>\n\t\t\t</social_networks>\n\t\t\t<external_links>\n\t\t\t\t<link>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-14613679</link>\n\t\t\t</external_links>\n\t\t\t<related_crises>\n\t\t\t\t<crisisRef>Libyan_Civil_War</crisisRef>\n\t\t\t</related_crises>\n\t\t</person>\n\t\t<person>\n\t\t\t<name>Mir Hossein Mousavi</name>\n\t\t\t<kind>Presidential Candidate of 2009 Iran\'s Elections</kind>\n\t\t\t<location>Tehran, Iran</location>\n\t\t\t<history>In 2009 Iranian Presidential election, Mousavi came out of semi-retirement and ran as one of two Reformist candidates against the Administration of incumbent President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.

Although the Iranian government prohibited any form of gathering by opposition-supporters in Tehran and across the country, significantly slowed down internet access and censored any form of media agreeing with the opposition, hundreds of thousands of Iranians chanted this motto, defying the law and challenging the Islamic Republic.</human_impact>\n\t\t\t<resources_needed>World Support</resources_needed>\n\t\t\t<ways_to_help>Oppose a Military Strike on Iran, Call for the Release of Opposition Leaders Under House Arrest, Call for the release of imprisoned human rights lawyer Nasrin Sotoudeh!</ways_to_help>\n\t\t\t<history>Protests following the 2009 Iranian presidential election against the disputed victory of Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and in support of opposition candidates Mir-Hossein Mousavi and Mehdi Karroubi occurred in major cities in Iran and around the world starting 13 June 2009. The protests were given several titles by their proponents including Green Revolution, Green Wave or Sea of Green, reflecting presidential candidate Mousavi\'s campaign color, and also Persian Awakening. The creation of the Iranian Green Movement was developed during these protests. The events have also been nicknamed the \"Twitter Revolution\" because of the protesters\' reliance on Twitter and other social-networking Internet sites to communicate with each other. Islamic politician Ata\'ollah Mohajerani blasted the election as \"the end of the Islamic Republic\". In response to the protests, other groups rallied in Tehran to support Ahmadinejad. Widespread editorial analyses assert that the 2009 election marks the official end of the Islamic Republic and the beginning of the Islamic emirate or an imamate regime. All three opposition candidates claimed that the votes were manipulated and the election was rigged, and candidates Mohsen Rezaee and Mousavi have lodged official complaints. Mousavi announced that he \"won\'t surrender to this manipulation\" before lodging an official appeal against the result to the Guardian Council on 14 June. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei declared the unprecedented voter turnout and coinciding religious holidays as a \"divine assessment\" and urged the nation to unite, but later ostensibly ordered an investigation into the claims of voting fraud and irregularities as per the request of the Green movement leaders. Mousavi is not optimistic about his appeal, saying that many of the group\'s members \"during the election were not impartial\". Ahmadinejad called the election \"completely free\" and the outcome \"a great victory\" for Iran, dismissing the protests as little more than \"passions after a soccer match\". Police and the Basij (a paramilitary group) suppressed both peaceful demonstrating and rioting by using batons, pepper spray, sticks and, in some cases, firearms. The Iranian government has confirmed the deaths of 36 people during the protests, while unconfirmed reports by supporters of Mousavi allege that there have been 72 deaths (twice as many) in the three months following the disputed election. Iranian authorities have closed universities in Tehran, blocked web sites, blocked cell phone transmissions and text messaging, and banned rallies.</history>\n\t\t\t<images>\n\t\t\t\t<link>http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/66/6th_Day_-_Mousavi_inside_the_Crowd.jpg/800px-6th_Day_-_Mousavi_inside_the_Crowd.jpg</link>\n\t\t\t</images>\n\t\t\t<videos>\n\t\t\t\t<link>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quPXg_GoTOk&amp;feature=related</link>\n\t\t\t</videos>\n\t\t\t<social_networks>\n\t\t\t\t<link>http://www.facebook.com/Persian.Green.Movement</link>\n\t\t\t</social_networks>\n\t\t\t<external_links>\n\t\t\t\t<link>http://en.irangreenvoice.com</link>\n\t\t\t</external_links>\n\t\t\t<related_orgs>\n\t\t\t\t<orgRef>International_Campaign_for_Human_Rights_in_Iran</orgRef>\n\t\t\t</related_orgs>\n\t\t\t<related_people>\n\t\t\t\t<personRef>Mir_Hossein_Mousavi</personRef>\n\t\t\t</related_people>\n\t\t</crisis>\n\t\t<crisis>\n\t\t\t<name>Xinjiang Riots</name>\n\t\t\t<kind>anti-government/ethnic protest</kind>\n\t\t\t<location>Urumqi, Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, China</location>\n\t\t\t<date_and_time>5 July 2009</date_and_time>\n\t\t\t<human_impact>197 deaths, 1721 injured</human_impact>\n\t\t\t<economic_impact>Uyghur businesses destroyed by Chinese mob</economic_impact>\n\t\t\t<history>The July 2009 Xinjiang riots were a series of violent riots over several days that broke out on 5 July 2009 in Urumqi, the capital city of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR), in northwestern People\'s Republic of China (PRC). The first day\'s rioting, which involved at least 1,000 Uyghurs, began as a protest but escalated into violent attacks that mainly targeted Han (\"ethnic Chinese\") people. People\'s Armed Police were deployed, and two days later hundreds of Han people clashed with both police and Uyghurs. PRC officials said that a total of 197 people died, with 1,721 others injured and many vehicles and buildings destroyed; on the other hand, Uyghur exile groups say the death toll is higher. Many men disappeared during wide-scale police sweeps in the days following the riots; Human Rights Watch (HRW) documented 43 cases and said figures for real disappearances were likely to be much higher. </history>\n\t\t\t<images>\n\t\t\t\t<link>http://www.farwestchina.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Urumqi-Riots.jpg</link>\n\t\t\t\t<link>http://english.people.com.cn/mediafile/200907/07/P200907072014041872629287.jpg</link>\n\t\t\t\t<link>http://english.people.com.cn/mediafile/200907/07/P200907072014352294282832.jpg</link>\n\t\t\t\t<link>http://english.people.com.cn/mediafile/200907/07/P200907072018061766028774.jpg</link>\n\t\t\t\t<link>http://english.people.com.cn/mediafile/200907/07/P200907072017392257014210.jpg</link>\n\t\t\t\t<link>http://english.people.com.cn/mediafile/200907/07/P200907072017145684313201.jpg</link>\n\t\t\t\t<link>http://english.people.com.cn/mediafile/200907/07/P200907072016482444221649.jpg</link>\n\t\t\t\t<link>http://english.people.com.cn/mediafile/200907/07/P200907072016212332964133.jpg</link>\n\t\t\t\t<link>http://english.people.com.cn/mediafile/200907/07/P200907072015483259527910.jpg</link>\n\t\t\t\t<link>http://english.people.com.cn/mediafile/200907/07/P200907072015165972213332.jpg</link>\n\t\t\t\t<link>http://english.people.com.cn/mediafile/200907/07/P200907072014551663971071.jpg</link>\n\t\t\t</images>\n\t\t\t<videos>\n\t\t\t\t<link>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DN3gUoWTnkY</link>\n\t\t\t\t<link>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AzlgXQaJ3I</link>\n\t\t\t\t<link>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3jkr7fsdsc</link>\n\t\t\t\t<link>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwCHfBfF1m4</link>\n\t\t\t</videos>\n\t\t\t<social_networks>\n\t\t\t\t<link>https://twitter.com/#!/UYGHURS</link>\n\t\t\t</social_networks>\n\t\t\t<external_links>\n\t\t\t\t<link>http://english.cntv.cn/english/special/0705riots/UrumqiRiots/index.shtml</link>\n\t\t\t\t<link>http://cnreviews.com/life/news-issues/urumqi-riots-western-chinese-narratives-truths_20090708.html</link>\n\t\t\t\t<link>http://forum.globaltimes.cn/forum/showthread.php?t=912</link>\n\t\t\t\t<link>http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/china/5756766/China-riots-Twitter-and-YouTube-frustrate-censorship-attempts.html</link>\n\t\t\t</external_links>\n\t\t\t<related_orgs>\n\t\t\t\t<orgRef>World_Uyghur_Congress</orgRef>\n\t\t\t</related_orgs>\n\t\t\t<related_people>\n\t\t\t\t<personRef>Rebiya_Kadeer</personRef>\n\t\t\t</related_people>\n\t\t</crisis>\n\t</crises>\n\t<orgs>\n\t\t<org>\n\t\t\t<name>World Uyghur Congress</name>\n\t\t\t<kind>international org. of exiled Uyghurs</kind>\n\t\t\t<location>80103 Munich, Germany</location>\n\t\t\t<history>The World Uyghur Congress (WUC) is an international organisation that represents the collective interest of the Uyghur people both in East Turkestan and abroad.

The ICC is an independent international organisation, and is not part of the United Nations system. Its seat is at The Hague in the Netherlands. Although the Court\'s expenses are funded primarily by States Parties, it also receives voluntary contributions from governments, international organisations, individuals, corporations and other entities. The international community has long aspired to the creation of a permanent international court, and, in the 20th century, it reached consensus on definitions of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. The Nuremberg and Tokyo trials addressed war crimes, crimes against peace, and crimes against humanity committed during the Second World War.\nIn the 1990s after the end of the Cold War, tribunals like the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia and for Rwanda were the result of consensus that impunity is unacceptable. However, because they were established to try crimes committed only within a specific time-frame and during a specific conflict, there was general agreement that an independent, permanent criminal court was needed.\nOn 17 July 1998, the international community reached an historic milestone when 120 States adopted the Rome Statute, the legal basis for establishing the permanent International Criminal Court. The Rome Statute entered into force on 1 July 2002 after ratification by 60 countries. </history>\n\t\t\t<contact_info>\n\t\t\t\t<email>visits@icc-cpi.int</email>\n\t\t\t\t<phone_number>+ 31 (0)70 515 8515</phone_number>\n\t\t\t\t<address>Po Box 19519\n2500 CM, The Hague\nThe Netherlands</address>\n\t\t\t</contact_info>\n\t\t\t<images>\n\t\t\t\t<link>http://archive2.globalsolutions.org/files/general/icc.jpg</link>\n\t\t\t\t<link>http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ae/International_Criminal_Court_logo.svg/673px-International_Criminal_Court_logo.svg.png</link>\n\t\t\t</images>\n\t\t\t<videos>\n\t\t\t\t<link>http://youtu.be/zfo7lMnR4O8</link>\n\t\t\t</videos>\n\t\t\t<social_networks>\n\t\t\t\t<link>http://www.facebook.com/pages/International-Criminal-Court/106219979409522</link>\n\t\t\t\t<link>http://twitter.com/#!/IntlCrimCourt</link>\n\t\t\t</social_networks>\n\t\t\t<external_links>\n\t\t\t\t<link>http://www.icc-cpi.int</link>\n\t\t\t</external_links>\n\t\t\t<related_crises>\n\t\t\t\t<crisisRef>Libyan_Civil_War</crisisRef>\n\t\t\t</related_crises>\n\t\t</org>\n\t\t<org>\n\t\t\t<name>Amnesty International</name>\n\t\t\t<kind>non-governmental organisation focused on human rights</kind>\n\t\t\t<location>Global, General secretariat in London</location>\n\t\t\t<history>Amnesty International (commonly known as Amnesty and AI) is a non-governmental organization focused on human rights with over 3 million members and supporters around the world.

Amnesty draws attention to human rights abuses and campaigns for compliance with international laws and standards. It works to mobilize public opinion to put pressure on governments that let abuse take place. The organization was awarded the 1977 Nobel Peace Prize for its \"campaign against torture\", and the United Nations Prize in the Field of Human Rights in 1978</history>\n\t\t\t<contact_info>\n\t\t\t\t<email>Various department emails available at www.amnesty.org.</email>\n\t\t\t\t<phone_number>+44-20-74135500</phone_number>\n\t\t\t\t<address>1 Easton Street\nLondon\nWC1X 0DW, UK</address>\n\t\t\t</contact_info>\n\t\t\t<images>\n\t\t\t\t<link>http://www.codoc.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/amnesty.jpeg</link>\n\t\t\t</images>\n\t\t\t<videos>\n\t\t\t\t<link>http://www.youtube.com/user/AmnestyInternational</link>\n\t\t\t</videos>\n\t\t\t<social_networks>\n\t\t\t\t<link>http://twitter.com/#!/amnesty</link>\n\t\t\t</social_networks>\n\t\t\t<external_links>\n\t\t\t\t<link>http://www.amnesty.org</link>\n\t\t\t\t<link>http://www.amnesty.org/en/news/iran-must-avoid-excessive-force-against-green-movement-protests-2012-02-13</link>\n\t\t\t</external_links>\n\t\t\t<related_crises>\n\t\t\t\t<crisisRef>Syrian_Uprising</crisisRef>\n\t\t\t\t<crisisRef>Xinjiang_Riots</crisisRef>\n\t\t\t\t<crisisRef>Libyan_Civil_War</crisisRef>\n\t\t\t</related_crises>\n\t\t\t<related_people>\n\t\t\t\t<personRef>Rebiya_Kadeer</personRef>\n\t\t\t\t<personRef>Mustafa_Abdul_Jalil</personRef>\n\t\t\t\t<personRef>Bashar_al-Assad</personRef>\n\t\t\t\t<personRef>Mir_Hossein_Mousavi</personRef>\n\t\t\t</related_people>\n\t\t</org>\n\t\t<org>\n\t\t\t<name>International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran</name>\n\t\t\t<kind>Campaign</kind>\n\t\t\t<location>Netherlands</location>\n\t\t\t<history>In late 2007, human rights activists working in the framework of the Dutch nongovernmental organization Foundation for Human Security in the Middle East resolved to found an international initiative focused on the urgent challenges faced by the Iranian people, and in particular civil society and the human rights community.The human rights community in Iran is in an exposed and dangerous position, subject to severe persecution and without effective support from the international community. International tensions provide a pretext for increasing repression within Iran, and remove human rights from the international agenda. The vibrant social movements in Iran movements, inter alia, of women, students, and workers work courageously in an un-free environment, subject to tremendous official pressures. They urgently need and welcome international concerns and solidarity, which must be strengthened through more effective support from international civil society and intergovernmental institutions.</history>\n\t\t\t<contact_info>\n\t\t\t\t<email>info@iranhumanrights.org</email>\n\t\t\t\t<phone_number>0000000</phone_number>\n\t\t\t\t<address>Netherlands</address>\n\t\t\t</contact_info>\n\t\t\t<images>\n\t\t\t\t<link>http://www.iranhumanrights.org/wp-content/uploads/Ronaghi21-300x2171.jpg</link>\n\t\t\t</images>\n\t\t\t<videos>\n\t\t\t\t<link>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-Kmb1Hm0n0&amp;feature=player_embedded</link>\n\t\t\t</videos>\n\t\t\t<social_networks>\n\t\t\t\t<link>http://www.facebook.com/pages/International-Campaign-for-Human-Rights-in-Iran/49929580840</link>\n\t\t\t</social_networks>\n\t\t\t<external_links>\n\t\t\t\t<link>http://www.iranhumanrights.org</link>\n\t\t\t</external_links>\n\t\t\t<related_crises>\n\t\t\t\t<crisisRef>Iranian_Green_Movement</crisisRef>\n\t\t\t</related_crises>\n\t\t\t<related_people>\n\t\t\t\t<personRef>Mir_Hossein_Mousavi</personRef>\n\t\t\t</related_people>\n\t\t</org>\n\t</orgs>\n</everything>")
